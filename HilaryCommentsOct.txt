Great start. Good code.

Good use of git with good commit messages.

You should have a .gitignore file

Delete and remove old code and old files from the repository that is not needed to create the results that you will put into the report. The point of using a version control system such as git is that you can always get back old code.

I cannot run your code because I do not have Matrix_test

Do not leave my teaching comments:
# If you are using Python 2.7 rather than Python 3, import various
# functions from Python 3 such as to use real number division
# rather than integer division. ie 3/2  = 1.5  rather than 3/2 = 1
#from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function
at the top of files

Instead of:
        phi =  np.linalg.solve(timeStepMatrix, phiOld)
        phiOld = phi.copy()
you can just do:
        phi =  np.linalg.solve(timeStepMatrix, phi)
so you don't need so many arrays defined.

#You should compare schemes with FTBS and CTCS. FTBS and CTCS should be used as the very simple naive schemes that you should aim to beat.

#You should also implement one of the schemes from chapter 6 of the notes to show that schemes exist that can do better than CTCS and FTBS
