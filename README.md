Python 3 code for linear advection assignment. It runs five numerical schemes for the linear advection equation and saves plots of the scheme results for differenct courant numbers and different number of time steps.

It also analyses the schemes via a series of tests. Plots of these test results are also saved.

All code is run from numericsReportResults.py.

In order to run this code you will first need to create a directory called "plots" with two sub-directories "illustrations" and "analysis". 

Note that in order to use matplotlib with python3 you may need to install python3-matplotlib.
Note that for the Semi-lagrangian scheme you must install scipy.interpolate.
